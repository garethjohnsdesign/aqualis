Using a combination of the oldest ingredients in perfumery, Origin expands like a galactic explosion of matter, conceding to the serenity of a new universe.

In the heart Egyptian Jasmine Absolute and Turkish Rose Absolute unfurl revealing a surprisingly delicate scent. French Vanilla Bourbon provides sweetness to the base, complimented by the earthiness of French Patchouli Heart. Finally, Indian Papyrus Oil leaves Origin with a lasting ancient and exotic quality.
