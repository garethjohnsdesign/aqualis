A coda concludes the passage of time, introduces the close of musical symphonies, and the final dance of the Swan in Swan Lake. A natural, deliberate and beautifully considered climax.

Cinnamon Bark Oil and pressed Egyptian bergamot creates a unique opening. Turkish Rose Absolute and Egyptian Rose Absolute feature, but the true beauty of Coda lies in the base. Namibian Myrrh, the sweetness of Indonesian Benzoin Resinoid and highly sensual French Labdanum Absolute provides a base that will endure well after the last notes have sung their final song.
