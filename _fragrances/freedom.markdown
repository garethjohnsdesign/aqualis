Freedom was inspired by Brenton on Sea in South Africa, where the South African Loerie birds soar freely over the endless coastline of sea and sand. A place of freedom and inspiration for Aqualis founder Steyn Grobler.

Fresh Pressed Egyptian Bergamot hangs with a comforting scent in the air. A grounding base of Oak Moss and Sun Bleached Driftwood glow in your surroundings, intertwining with wisps of Haitian Vetiver. Waves of Aqueous Salt Water and Mint envelop the nose creating freshness and weightlessness.
