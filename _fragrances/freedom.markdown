Freedom was inspired by Brenton on Sea in South Africa, where the native Knysna Turaco birds soar freely over the endless coastline of sea and sand. A place of Freedom and inspiration for Steyn.

Pressed Egyptian Bergamot and Spanish Thyme Oil combine with a Marine and Sea Salt Accord. This transcends the wearer to that moment you smell the ocean for the first time after a long journey from the city. Cape Immortelle Absolute is an indigenous fynbos that grows along the Brenton coast line which gives Freedom an herbaceous hay-like character in the heart. The whole creation is complimented by Haitian Vetiver, Oak Moss and White Musk in the base.
