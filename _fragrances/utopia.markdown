Utopia transforms our surroundings, leading us to a state of meditation, peace and stillness. 

Jacaranda Absolute pays homage to Steynâ€™s childhood in Pretoria, where the city is lit up by purple and blue Jacaranda trees during the height of summer. Alongside the Jacaranda Absolute, French Osmanthus Absolute plays a central role in the heart of Utopia. Its telling peach and apricot accords instil the senses with a balance of airborne sweetness on a Suede and French Vanilla Bourbon base.
