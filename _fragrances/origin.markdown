Using a combination of the oldest ingredients in perfumery, Origin expands like a galactic explosion of matter, conceding to the serenity of a new universe.

In the heart Egyptian Jasmine Absolute and Turkish Rose Absolute unfurl, revealing a delicate scent. French Vanilla Bourbon provides sweetness to the base, complimented by French Patchouli Heart and the ancient quality of Indian Papyrus Oil. Steyn wanted to use an ingredient that pays tribute to his own half-Namibian Origin. So Namibian Myrrh, used by women of the Himba Tribe for thousands of years, was sourced to give Origin its authenticity and rareness.
