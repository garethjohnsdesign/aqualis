Aqualis is an amalgam of ‘Aqua’ and ‘Qualis’, the two founding concepts behind our brand ethos. The term ‘Aqua’ relates to the fragrances, the perfume, the very essence of the brand. ‘Qualis’, which derives from the Latin word ‘Qualia’, is a philosophical term used to define the subjective properties of experience, characterised by a rendering of the unfamiliar into the familiar. Qualia define who we are and how we use all of our senses to interpret the world we live in; a badge of individuality. 

Aqualis is about each customer’s individual interpretation of the fragrance and their personal experience and journey; we want to know how each fragrance makes them feel. Our philosophy is to build a marriage between fine fragrance and one’s individuality. We create fragrances that push the boundaries of conventional perfumery by using ingredients that have been meticulously selected from all around the world and couple them with a range of concepts depicted by way of stunning imagery. 

###### Evolution  
Evolution is the first series by Aqualis that is composed of four fragrances Origins, Freedom, Utopia and Coda. Evolution is based on four different concepts that evoke different meanings and feelings in each and every individual. The fragrances themselves attempt to capture the essence of each concept and, coupled with beautiful artwork, take the wearer on a journey. Although each wearer will interpret each concept differently and react differently to the perfume, they will have one thing in common; individuality. 

###### The Founders
